# Tests whether or not reflexive anaphora are resolved in the encoder or
# decoder by performing arithmetic of the following sort with the 
# encoded hidden states prior to decoding.
#   (1)  Grace verb1 herself - Grace verb2 P2 + P3 verb2 P2
# This dataset, for metrics purposes, presumes that the resolution happens in
# the encoder, and hence "success" means that the decoding of (1) should
# look like
#   (2)  verb1 ( P3 , grace )
# 
# This is the in-domain case, assuming that models have been trained
# on Grace-reflexive sentences, and so should be used with experiments 1 and 2.
